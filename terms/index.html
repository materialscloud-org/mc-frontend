</p> <h5>3.4.7 Liability</h5> <p>
You and/or the company or entity on behalf of which you use your account
        shall be liable to EPFL, the other Users and any others for any damages
        or claims arising from your unlawful use of the Services or the Website

</p> </section> <section class="space-y-2"> <h3>
4. User-Uploaded Content
</h3><h4>4.1 User's Responsibility and EPFL's Right to Remove</h4> <p>
You may create and/or upload Content while using the Services. You are
          solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting
          from, any User-Uploaded Content (including any Third Party's Content)
          that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the
          Services, regardless of the form of that content. EPFL is not
          responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Uploaded
          Content.
</p> <p>
EPFL does not pre-screen User-Uploaded Content, but EPFL has the right
          (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Uploaded
          Content that EPFL determines, in its sole discretion, to violate the
          Terms of Use or any law.
</p> <p>
You agree that EPFL may remove any User-Uploaded Content that EPFL in
          its sole discretion determines to be inappropriate.
</p> <h4>4.2 Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4> <p>
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own
        and up-load on Materials Cloud.
</p> <p>
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content,
        EPFL needs you to grant EPFL, and the other Materials Cloud Users,
        certain legal permissions, listed in Sections 4.4 to 4.7. These license
        grants apply to Your Content. You understand that you will not receive
        any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections 4.4 to 4.7. The
        licenses you grant hereunder are perpetual. If you upload Content that
        already comes with a license granting EPFL the permissions EPFL needs to
        run the Services, no additional license is required.
</p> <p>
Since the goal of Materials Cloud is to disseminate scientific research
        results in an open science framework, you may not request the removal of
        your Content (save for Content uploaded in your Private Area) unless you
        can show a legitimate reason for such removal.
</p> <h4>4.3 Third Party's Content</h4> <p>
Before up-loading any Third Party's Content, you must make sure that you
        have the right to up-load them on Materials Cloud, which is an open
        environment. So, you hereby warrants that you are either the sole owner
        of the Content you up-load or, if this is not the case, that you did
        obtain all authorizations from the lawful owner(s) of such content to
        up-load it and grant the licenses listed in Sections 4.4 to 4.7.
</p> <p>
You shall indemnify and hold EPFL, its partners and any sub-contractor
        harmless against any claims and damages arising from your up-loading of
        any Third Party's Content.
</p> <h4>4.4 License Grant to EPFL</h4> <p>
EPFL needs the legal right to do things like host Your Content and any
        Third Party's Content you up-load, namely publish them and share them.
        You hereby grant EPFL, its service providers or sub-contractors and EPFL
        legal successors the right to use, store, parse, and display Your
        Content and any Third Party's Content you up-load, and make incidental
        copies thereof as necessary to render the Website and provide the
        Services. This includes the right to do things like copy such contents
        to the Materials Cloud database and make backups; show them to you and
        other users; use such contents to provide the Services; parse them into
        a search index or otherwise analyze them on our servers; share them with
        other users; and perform them, in case Your Content or any Third Party's
        Content you up-load is something like audio and/or video recordings.
</p> <h4>4.5 License Grant to Other Users</h4> <p>
Any of Your Content or any Third Party's Content you up-load on
        Materials Cloud, including issues, comments, and contributions to other
        Users' repositories, may be viewed by others, save for Content uploaded
        in the &ldquo;Private Repository&rdquo; as defined in Section 4.8.
</p> <p>
Save for Content you upload in the &ldquo;Private Repository&rdquo; as
        defined in Section 4.8., you grant each User of Materials Cloud a
        nonexclusive, worldwide and perpetual license to use, display, and
        perform Your Content and any Third Party's Content you up-load on
        Materials Cloud through the Materials Cloud Services and to reproduce
        said contents solely on Materials Cloud as permitted through Materials
        Cloud's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a
        license, for example open source license for software or Creative
        Commons for other copyrighted works.
</p> <p>
It is reminded that if you are uploading any Third Party Content, you
        are responsible for ensuring that the content you upload is licensed
        under terms that grant these permissions to other Materials Cloud Users.
</p> <h4>4.6 Contributions Under Repository License</h4> <p>
Whenever you make a contribution to any Materials Cloud repository
        containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the
        same terms, and you shall make sure that you have the right to license
        your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to
        license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor
        license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
</p> <h4>4.7 Moral Rights</h4> <p>
To the extent Your Content benefits from copyright protection, you
        retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or
        submit to any part of the Services, including the rights of integrity
        and attribution unless otherwise provided in any license you attached to
        Your Content in accordance with Section 4.5 or in any license attached

            abovementioned sub-contracting entity) accesses a private repository
            for support reasons, we will only do so with the User's consent and
            knowledge; or
</li> <li>when access is required for security reasons</li> <li>when accessing it for backup or service maintenance reasons.</li> </ul>  <p>
If EPFL has reason to believe the contents of a private area are in
        violation of the law or of these Terms of Use, EPFL has the right to
        access, review, and remove them. Additionally, EPFL may be compelled by
        law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.
